# TrainTime

I created a Firebase backed train schedule application which accepts user input to add new train name, start time and frequency to schedule. Displays schedule in repeating table with next arrival based on current time and frequency of train stops. Stores Train info in Firebase for data persistence and retreives information from database on load. Schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information. 

Used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

Used Firebase to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js 
to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.

Technology Used:
Javascript
jQuery
HTML5
CSS
Firebase
Moment.js
